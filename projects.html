<h2>DANCE</h2>
<div class="caps">
<p>Dancing has always been my hobby since childhood but I wanted to get into competing and college gave me a chance to be a part of the bollywood dance team andaaz on campus and also making new friends from it. 
I have always been dancing as an exercise and a way to clear my mind with my buddies during college.</p>

<h2>STUDY SESSIONS</h2>
<div class="caps">
<p>Study sessions have always been the best memories I've had in college.From not being able to understand a single part of the material, to the cry sessions and having friends around you to study with and work together and how can we not forget the mini food and nap breaks.I found myself being a lot more productive through these study sessions.</p>

<div class="coloumns">
<h2>TRAVEL</h2>
<div class="caps">
<p>Travelling memories have been very fun.I like travelling but when I did it while being a 
student working on a budget, you learn a lot more on spending wisely and visiting these places 
with friends is just making more and more memories. I have travelled to a lot of places like mexico,texas,california,new york,arizona,etc.
I will advise every college student to always take trips when they get time during the breaks as its a beautiful experience and a lot to 
learn from.</p>

<h2>FUN TIMES</h2>
<div class="caps">
<p> The college weekends is what most of us in college look forward to. 
I am talking about just spending time away from classes with friends doing bowling, laser tag, outdoor sports and 
also how can we forget the parties and all the memories made from them, just dancing away and overall having a 
good time.</p>
